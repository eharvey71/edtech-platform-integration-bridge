Deployment
==========

There are several deployment strategies for the Integration Bridge application.

#. Self-hosted. Build from the repository and host in a datacenter at your institution.
#. Vendor-hosted. Bundle with a solution and give institutional admins access for configuration.
#. Cloud-hosted and managed by the developer. Hosted and customized for your needs. Depending on use-case, cost would be fair. For example, hosting an instance on Google Cloud has resulted in pennies a month due to the low network and storage utilization.

In all cases, customizations of the integration bridge may be required. More is covered in the :ref:`Customization` section of this doc.
